# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on PhD Publications Dataset

## Project Overview
This repository documents a comprehensive EDA on the **PhD Publications** dataset, aimed at exploring various analytical methods covered in the Digital Assessment course. The goal is to uncover insights into PhD publication patterns using a range of techniques, from data cleaning to advanced model evaluation.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this analysis, **PhDPublications.csv**, captures publication-related attributes of PhD candidates. You can access the dataset here: [PhD Publications Dataset](https://github.com/sahith-krishna19/EDA/blob/main/PhDPublications.csv).

## Objectives
- Conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset.
- Implement data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
- Progress through Modules 1 to 7 with hands-on application of theoretical concepts.

## Module Overview
This project follows a modular approach, with each section aligned to a specific EDA concept or technique as outlined in the course syllabus.

### Module 1: Introduction to EDA
Begins with an introductory exploration of the datasetâ€™s structure, initial statistics, and preliminary visualizations to identify patterns and outliers.

### Module 2: Data Transformation
Focuses on preparing the dataset for analysis, including deduplication, data discretization, value replacement, and handling of missing values through various imputation methods.

### Module 3: Correlation & Time Series Analysis
Analyzes relationships between variables through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Time Series Analysis (TSA) is also introduced, enabling the identification of trends within temporal data.

### Module 4: Data Summarization and Visualization
Provides a comprehensive look at statistical summaries, followed by visualization techniques such as contingency tables, scatter plots, and bar charts for effective data interpretation.

### Module 5: Clustering Analysis
Introduces clustering techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering. Clustering helps to uncover natural groupings within the data, and this module also covers methods for detecting outliers.

### Module 6: Dimensionality Reduction
Applies dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to simplify the dataset while preserving critical features.

### Module 7: Model Development and Evaluation
Concludes with model-building activities, including linear regression and reinforcement learning basics. Models are evaluated on accuracy and other metrics to ensure reliability and insightfulness.

## Summary
This EDA journey offers a structured approach to understanding and analyzing the PhD Publications dataset, following data science principles and course guidelines. Each module builds on the previous, providing a thorough grounding in data analysis, visualization, and model evaluation techniques.

Happy analyzing!
